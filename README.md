Wander around Smith College as a student and fight homework

We wanted to make a game focused on the college student experience. This game is roughly modeled on Pokemon. It's a whimsical take on the everyday struggle between studying and procrastination. It's also a great de-stressor because you can actually beat your homework in it!

The character, a Smith student, runs around the campus. Various buildings have different homework assignments that the student can either fight and complete or procrastinate and run away from.
